# NoSQL

The biggest tech companies in the world are using NoSQL to support modern applications. It is a database solution that is recognized
for ease of development, functionality and performance at scale.

Today, the most popular NoSQL solutions are:
1. Redis (Very popular amongst companies of all sizes, ie: Pinterest, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, Github, Hulu, Coinbase, 
Instacart, Slack, Hulu, etc)
2. MongoDB (Used by Google, Facebook, Expedia, GAP, Nokia, etc)
3. Apache Cassandra (Used by Appple, Chase, Verizon, Capital One, Samsung Mobile)
4. AWS Dynamo
5. MS Azure Cosmos DB

In the computer hardware industry, it is very important to not only validate compatibility of software on new hardware, 
but to optimize performance. Since Redis is such an important database solution for key services that billions of users rely on everyday,
many data/service providers really appreciate Redis Benchmarks. In fact, VMware presents Redis Benchmarks every year in partnership with HPE.

This repository has been created to reveal exactly how my team setup Redis, so other companies can configure their servers in a similar manner
to compare against our Redis benchmak.
